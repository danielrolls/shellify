# Shellify

Want to quicky get something to build and to have it reproducable and sharable? With [`nix`](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/nix-shell.html) it is easy to quickly add dependencies to get something to build. It's also easy to work quickly and iteratively. With this tool, once you're done you can save a `shell.nix` so that you and anybody else can quickly and instantly rebuild with an identical environment with all the same dependencies. With this tool you can quickly swap out `nix-shell` or `nix shell` for `nix-shellify` to create the necessary `shell.nix`. It makes saving a basic working `shell.nix` almost instant. Read one of the short examples below to understand the workflow.

## Prerequisites

This utility assumes [nix is installed](https://nixos.org/download.html).


## Example usage without flakes

I want to run a program called `foo`. When I run `./foo` it complains I don't have python. So I run `nix-shell -p python` and try running `./foo` again.

Now it complains I don't have asciidoc so I come out of the shell and edit the last command to add asciidoc by running `nix-shell -p python asciidoc`. Now it works.

I exit my shell and change `nix-shell -p python asciidoc` to `nix-shellify -p python asciidoc`. It then creates a `shell.nix` which I keep next to foo. Now I can just type `nix-shell` and I have what I need to run foo. I can share and everybody else can run foo too without the same search. They also don't need to run it in a conatainer or VM or to maintain depenencies on their system themself. 

## Example usage with flakes

I want to run something called `foo`. When I run `./foo` it complains I don't have python. So I run `nixshell nixpkgs#python` and try running `./foo` again.

Now it complains I didn't have asciidoc so I come out of the shell and edit the last command to add asciideoc by running `nix shell nixpkgs#python nixpkgs#asciidoc`. Now it works.

I exit my shell and change `nix shell nixpkgs#python nixpkgs#asciidoc` to `nix-shellify --with-flakes nixpkgs#python nixpkgs#asciidoc`. It then creates a `flake.nix` and `shell.nix` which I commit in git next to foo. Now I can just type `nix develop` and I have what I need to run foo. I can share and everybody else can run foo too without the same search. I can also go on to tell nix to run as an app or to just make `foo` avaiable handling dependencies for me.
